Section 11
---------------

Dont forget that in for loop or in any codition it can be i = i +2 kind of condition as well instead of i++

in for loop, none of the part is manadatory - initialization, codition or increment. 


int i = 1;

for (;i<=10;i++)  <-- valid. 

for (int j = 1; j<=10;){  <--valid

sysop();
j++

} 


==============================

Eclipse feature. 

just type main and ctrl+space to get defination of main method.  other templates are sysout etc.. 

We can create our own template from preference -> template -> java -> editor tempaltes. 

==============================

Syntax of while is similar to if condition. 

int i =0 

while (i <= 5) {
System.out.println(i);
i++
} 

================

do while loop  -- code executes once - guanteed  -- its usage in Square_Cube_section_11_128

do {
	System.out.println(i);
	i++
} while (i<=5);


==============

Dont forget about break and continue in any loop. 

Break - takes controller out of the loop. 
Continue - stops that particular exeuction at that point and  continues the loop. 

check good example of continue -- print even numbers in - Square_Cube_section_11_128


==============

Almost all program can be written by any loop, for , while or do while. 

But which loops we can select can be determined by following questions : 

Do you know how many times loops going to run ? 

	- For loop. 
	
Do you just know when to end the loop ?

	- While loop 
	
Do you want to exeucte loop at least once ? 

	- Do While loop.
