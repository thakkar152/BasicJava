Section 4 : 

Method declaration in jshell (or do not pass modifier, it will be defaulted) : 

jshell> public void multiplication(int x) {
   ...> for (int i = 1 ; i <=10 ; i++ ) {
   ...> System.out.printf("%d X %d = %d", x,i,x*i);
   ...> }
   ...> }
|  created method multiplication(int)

Calling : multiplication(10);

===========================

/methods gives list of methods already defined in Jshell. 

/save <filename> -- saves whatever you have executed in that session of JShell. Including all methods which you have created. 

/edit <name of method> -- To edit that particualar method in Jshell. You can also edit by declaring method again with the same name. 

/list <name of method> -- This will show your method declaration. 

Parameter is when we declare method and argument is when we call that method passing an argument/value (feed value to the parameter).
