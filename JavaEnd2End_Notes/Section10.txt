Section 10 :

In nested if..else if ...else. Once condition is met, it does not check further condition and controls comes out of the block. 

==========================================================

i = 0

if(i)  {
 System.out.println("i is 0")
}

This program will give an error as in java int value are not allowed in condition. (whereas in c++ this is valid)

=============================================


In java Scanner is a class using which you can take input from the user. 

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)  <-- java.util.Scanner.
int number = scanner.nextInt();

=====================
switch syntax -- exsercise - TakeChoiceFromUserForOperation_section10_112;

All the below cases will get executed if one of the case matches. prevent it to be happening by using break;. 

placement of default block doesnt matter in switch. 

Switch on long,double,float,boolean variable is not valid, only valid switches are on int, short, byte, string, enum. 

case cannot have relational or logical operatior like case choice > 5 :

int choice = 4;
switch (choice) {

		case 1:
			System.out.println("Sum is : " + co.sum());
			break;
		case 2:
			System.out.println("Substraction is : " + co.substraction());
			break;
		case 3:
			System.out.println("Multiplication is : " + co.multiply());
			break;
		case 4:
			System.out.println("Division is : " + co.division());
			break;
		default:
			System.out.println("Invlid Choice");
			break;

		}
		
		
=========================================

static method can be called from main static method without object. static method cannot be there inside main.  (can refer RestartTutorial -> SimpleCalculatorBigDecimalRunner.java as well for this)

default does not require break, but its good practice. 

Refer SwitchExercise_seciton10_118

================================

return statement within switch is kind of break only. Code wont execute after return.
